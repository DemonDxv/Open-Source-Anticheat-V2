# Credits
If you decide to take any code from this anticheat for reselling purposes, all I ask is for proper crediting to the people that worked on it.

# Note

The anticheat is currently in a developmental stage, and can be buggy at times. 

Remember not all the code is finished, this github page for the anticheat may not be 100.0% correct, and may be slightly misinformative.
